# LDAautocorrect
Just a simple script that can automatically get the mistakes and remove the variables unsatisfied LDA conditions.

These are super easy scripts that I wrote recently.
I use github to keep a record of my scripts. I always forget where my scripts are.
Well, I am hardly a skilled programmer.
I pick up programming back after 3 years of working on all kinds of chemistry experiments and biochemistry experiments. I used to be an undergraduate of Biomedical Engineering but due to the special division of my college and school, I was actually in the field of biochem. Now I am an upcoming postgraduate in Bioinformatics.

I really want to be a developer like Those super cool programmers helping Biology in data field.

This is a playground of mine.
You don't have to read this bullock.

Warning: Because the scripts are super easy, You may not find my annotation. Please notice this.

Anyway, if you have better ideas, contact me through commends. I will set a proper email address for this account later.
Your sincere Margaret the Curly Hair.
