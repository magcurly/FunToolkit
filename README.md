# LDAautocorrect
Just a simple script that can automatically get the mistakes and remove the variables unsatisfied LDA conditions.

This is a super easy perl script that I wrote recently.
I use github to keep a record of my scripts.
Well, I am hardly a skilled programmer.
I pick up programming back after 3 years of working on all kinds of chemistry experiments and biochemistry experiments. I used to be an undergraduate of Biomedical Engineering but due to the special division of my college and school, I actually learned to be in the field of biochem. Now I am an upcoming postgraduate in Bioinformatics.

I really want to be a developer like Those super cool programmers helping Biology in data field.

This is a playground of mine.
You don't have to read this bullock.

Warning: Because the script is super easy, You may not find my annotation. Please notice this.
